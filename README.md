This Walkthrough will display all the functionality of the application.

### Search for Home 

If the user decided to search for their home through the search field, they must first enter in the desired postal code. Once the user confirms the postal code a list of homes will be displayed. These homes are password protected. Users choose the password for the home when registering the home with the application.
